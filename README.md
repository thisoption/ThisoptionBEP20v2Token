It is based in Toronto, Canada, and operates as a finance ecosystem consisting of Thisoption - the Binary Option Exchange, Tonstrade - the Social trading App, the Tonspay payment gateway, Extons - the Cryptocurrency exchange, and Tonsfx - the Forex Exchange. The entire Thisoption ecosystem creates and uses the TONS token, a BEP20-based token, as its primary coin. This token was first circulated on the Extons Cryptocurrency Exchange, and then to the Thisoption Exchange.
