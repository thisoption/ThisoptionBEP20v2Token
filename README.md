Thisoption provides its customers with the most advanced platform for Options and CFD trading with live video chat.

It is claimed that Thisoption was founded in 2016 as part of THISOPTION LIMITED FIRM EXMPTIONS POOLS & POOL EXEMPTIONS. It is based in Toronto, Canada, and operates as a finance ecosystem consisting of Thisoption - the Binary Option Exchange, Tonstrade - the Social trading App, the Tonspay payment gateway, Extons - the Cryptocurrency exchange, and Tonsfx - the Forex Exchange. The entire Thisoption ecosystem creates and uses the TONS token, a BEP20-based token, as its primary coin. This token was first circulated on the Extons Cryptocurrency Exchange, and then to the Thisoption Exchange.
